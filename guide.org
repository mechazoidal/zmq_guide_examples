*** [[http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#Getting-the-Message-Out]]
**** Interesting to note: the wuserver.rb will continually pump out messages on a PUB socket, so it will have high CPU usage.
**** But the sink/ventilator example is using PUSH/PULL, and they will sleep until they've actually got work to do.
*** Also note that we use trap("INT") in our Ruby tests, so that we can bail out with CTRL-C. [[http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#-MQ][This only started working in ZMQ 2.1]].
**** (I think)
*** Interesting oops: trying to use a Ruby int for a SUB filter in setsockopt will cause a segfault(in the FFI connection?)
*** [[http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#Socket-Scalability]]
**** Interesting: the ruby proc for wuserver stayed around 110% CPU, while kernel_task was at 20%. Individual wuclient procs were around 8%.
